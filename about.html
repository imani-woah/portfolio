                <div class="left">Hi hi! I'm Imani, I'm a graphic design student currently studying at Virginia Commonwealth University. I'm very comfortable working with the Adobe suite, including Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, and Premiere. On top of my design skills, I've also been an illustrator for much of my life and love incorporating it with my graphic design!
                <br>
                <br>
                I'm currently growing my skills with HTML web coding (I made this site myself, if you couldn't tell!).
                <br>
                <br>
                When I'm not designing, I'm delving into my other hobbies such as writing, playing video games, or hanging out with my cat!</div>
